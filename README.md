# ExoplanetsHabitability
## Calculating exoplanets' habitability indexes in C++
### Comments
This is my C/C++ timed exercise
### Description
This program is calculating exoplanet's habitability using [Earth Similarity Index (ESI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Similarity_Index). 
I had to create a Planet `.h` and `.cpp` file to represent Planet class with overloaded I/O and relational operators. I also had to implement unit testing to test
Planet class methods. Finally, in the main class I had to debug and optimise code for the programm to run smoothly including pointers and dynamic memory allcoation.
